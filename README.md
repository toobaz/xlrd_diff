# xlrd_diff
This is a simple script for "diffing" Excel files.

It is based on xlrd.

Notice the [ExcelCompare](https://github.com/na-ka-na/ExcelCompare)
project has many more options, a better ouput, and support for more types of files.

(The motivation for xlrd_diff was just that ExcelCompare failed on some files)
